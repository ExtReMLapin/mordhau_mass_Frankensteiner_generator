# mordhau_mass_Frankensteiner_generator
Generate fuckedup mordhau faces in mass


Because the [Frankensteiner](https://github.com/Dealman/Frankensteiner) by [Dealman](https://github.com/Dealman) is good enough for 3-4 merceneries but not when you need to generate a lot of faces to find the one you like.

# [Watch this video to understand how to use it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZPcDFCUR8Q)


You need [lua binary](http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html) to execute the file



As explained in the video : 

* go in `AppData\Local\Mordhau\Saved\Config\WindowsClient\Game.ini`

* backup the file

* find the lines with `CharacterProfiles=(Name=INVTEXT(` at the start

* replace all the lines with the generated faces (from the generated file)

* pick what you want in the game using the mercenaries names (numbers)

* put them in a temp file

* restore the original file

* add the mercenaries face you likes at the end of the list of your original mercenaries.
